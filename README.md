Three files will be saved to this directory, 
 A Univariate EDA
 A Bivariate EDA
 A Multivariate EDA
 
To run the EDA tool on a different dataset, see the comments at the top of the file


To run a ML model with genetic algorithm execute "python3 GA_ForParams"
One file will be saved to this directory with the outputs. 

Currently the ML model will be a random forest. See the comments at the top of the file to change the type of ML model.
